# `p-memo`

A `pinocchio`-based Memo program.

## Overview

`p-memo` is a reimplementation of the SPL Memo program using [`pinocchio`](https://github.com/anza-xyz/pinocchio). The program uses at most `~5%` of the compute units used by the current Memo program when signers are present; even when there are no signers, it needs only `~20%` of the current Memo program compute units. This efficiency is achieved by a combination of:
1. `pinocchio` "lazy" entrypoint
2. `sol_log_pubkey` syscall to log pubkey values
3. [`pinocchio-log`](https://crates.io/crates/pinocchio-log) to format the memo message

Since it uses the syscall to log pubkeys, the output of the program is slightly different while loging the same information:
```
1: Program PMemo11111111111111111111111111111111111111 invoke [1]
2: Program log: Signed by:
3: Program log: 1111111QLbz7JHiBTspS962RLKV8GndWFwiEaqKM
4: Program log: Memo (len 60):
5: Program log: why does spl memo use 36000 cus to print len 60 msg of ascii
6: Program PMemo11111111111111111111111111111111111111 consumed 537 of 1400000 compute units
7: Program PMemo11111111111111111111111111111111111111 success
```

Logging begins with entry into the program (`line 1`). Then there is a separate log to start the signers section (`line 2`); this is only present if there are signer accounts. After that there will be one line for each signer account (`line 3`), followed by the memo length and UTF-8 text (`line 4-5`). The program ends with the status of the instruction (`lines 6-7`).

## Performance

CU comsumption:

| \# signers | p-memo      | SPL Memo  |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 0          | 313 (`15%`) | 2,022     |
| 1          | 537 (`4%`)  | 13,525    |
| 2          | 654 (`3%`)  | 25,111    |
| 3          | 771 (`2%`)  | 36,406    |
